SUMMON has been created out of a need to replace the event functionality of outdated social media. Instead of having a feed cluttered with advertising, status updates and photos of food, the idea is to create an application exclusively focused on events. The user will be able to create events, search for events, follow others to see desired events in a feed and sync the internal event calendar with commonly used calendars (like Google and Apple's calendars) in order to never miss an important event.
