SUMMON has been created out of a need to replace the event functionality of outdated social media. Instead of having a feed cluttered with status updates, advertising and photos of your third cousin's baby, the idea is to create an application exclusively focused on events. The user will be able to create new events, search for events, follow other users to see their events in a (customizable) feed and sync the app's internal calendar with commonly used calendars (like Google and Apple's calendars) in order to never miss something important.
